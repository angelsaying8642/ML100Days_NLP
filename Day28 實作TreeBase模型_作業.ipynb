       " 'I am already a baseball fan and knew a bit about the Negro leagues, but I learned a lot more reading this book.',\n",
       " \"This was a good story of the Black leagues. I bought the book to teach in my high school reading class. I found it very informative and exciting. I would recommend to anyone interested in the history of the black leagues. It is well written, unlike a book of facts. The McKissack's continue to write good books for young audiences that can also be enjoyed by adults!\",\n",
       " 'Today I gave a book about the Negro Leagues of Baseball to a traveling friend. Its a book I\\'ve read more than once and felt that my friend would truly enjoy. It felt like giving a gift that you wanted to keep for yourself. I parted with the book knowing that my friend would enjoy reading it on his journey back east. Before giving him the book I spent about thirty minutes flipping through its pages and saying goodbye to some of the stories in it. I know I\\'ll come across the book again, but for me, parting with books is like wishing a friend well on a journey, just as this friend of mine was journeying. Its great to send a visiting friend off with a friendly gift.\\n\\nWell, in leafing through the book\\'s pages I came across a few paragraphs I wanted to retain as a memory of my friend the book. Here below are the book and the lines from it that show in words what the negro baseball players faced every day of their lives; a color barrier that prevented them from gaining national sports recognition as professionals of the game they loved so much, baseball. Though Negro men had proven themselves heroic, capable of soldiering bravely in foreign battles of World War II, America was still treating them as second class citizens or less here at home. Major League Baseball would lead the nation in recovering from its racial prejudicial past. The nation today, even with a Black President, is still playing catch up.\\n\\nexcerpt from Black Diamond:  \"Only one thing is keeping them out of the big leagues, and that is the pigmentation of their skin.\" Shirley Povich washington post',\n",
       " 'The story of race relations in American history is one of lost opportunity.  This concise history of the Negro Baseball Leagues for young adult readers illustrates this basic point.  The book discusses the names, dates, and circumstances of the major figures and events of the flip side of American baseball history. Legendary names such as Josh Gibson, \"Cool Papa\" Bell, and Satchel Page are just a few of the remarkable players who made important contributions to the game.  Among others, they played for teams with names such as The Homestead Grays, The St. Louis Stars, and The Kansas City Monarchs.  The book also tells the story of owners and managers, such names as Negro National League founder Rube Foster and the tough as nails woman owner of the Newark Eagles, Effa Manley spring to mind.  The book also briefly explains how the infamous Jim Crow tradition brought about the Negro Baseball saga.  In 1947, major league baseball was sucessfully integrated and that spelled the doom of the Negro Baseball leagues.  The text includes an ample number of photographs.  To assist younger readers, and for easy reference purposes, a player profile and time line section is provided at the back of the book.  Underlying the historical text, there is the theme that segregated baseball mirrored the nagging problem of racism in America.  A sense of fair play and even-handed justice demands that talent, skill, and just plain style should be celebrated, regardless of race.  To do otherwise cheats everybody of a rewarding experience.  Imagine if the great players of the Negro Baseball Leagues had the chance to play (with or against) the great players of the major leagues.  Consider the void created by lost opportunity.  ;-)',\n",

I also would've liked to see more than one or two pages of Aisling illustrations.\\n\\nThat said, it's pretty much exactly how it's billed, and it's a really pretty (and really big) book that definitely showcases how gorgeous the movie was.

While some art books end up focusing on one aspect of it's respective movie, 'Desiging the Secret of Kells' explores not only how the creators painstakingly captured its beautiful art style, but also looks into character design, production process, story boarding and writing, and  much more. From the caption and footnotes in the book tells how much the creators are passionate about and love this masterpiece. Just flipping through this book was a joy. You have to read it to believe it. :>\",\n",

As I write this I am attending the 2014 San Diego Comic Con. I was so stoked. Anyway, the book not just discusses the film but is very transparent in detailing the process. Even down to giving the color codes of the characters like their eye lash color. Very cool and detailed. If you get your hands on one get it. This will be one that the resale value will remain solid.

I have a tool for opening / closing links of chain and I used it, but the result was a very wide V shape and I didn't want to put the somewhat fragile plastic handle in position while I used the tool to squeeze the V shape into more of a C shape.

In  the meantime, what then to do with one's razor and, more importantly, one's shaving brush which must be stored with the bristles facing downward so the knot does not get ruined from getting soaked?  Also, this unit is rather tall, so it will not easily fit into a cabinet recess or on a cabinet shelf.  I guess the unit is okay as long as you can leave it out, but I would still recommend placing it on  a dry paper towel after shaving to prevent mildew from forming and, worse, spreading.

The product comes with instructions for disassembly and thorough cleaning of the stand which I really appreciate.  The fact that it does not hold my particular razor does not cause me any real concern because, due to the number of different razor designs on the market these days, I doubt that it is possible to design a system that could work for every conceivable razor on the market.  Who knows, I may change razors next?\\nMy primary use for this stand from the start was to keep the beaver brush clean and to allow it to dry thoroughly between uses and it performs admirably for that purpose.  In addition it is well made and based on the quality of construction I anticipate that the finish and the stand will hold up for several years of everyday use.

       " 'crest whitestrips are one of the most popular among the store brand tooth whitening products  they were introduced to the public in 2001 and they have been satisfying customers ever since  they work by concentrating special whitening ingredients like peroxide directly against the teeth where they can penetrate the surface for a full thirty minutes  repeated usage for fourteen days should result in significantly whiter teeth   crest whitestrips claim that these strips can be worn and used any time and that  once in place  you can go on with your normal daily routine for 30 minutes while the strips have the opportunity to work  it is true that you can do what you want  but there are certain activities that are not easy to do with one of these strips in place  i m one of those people who has a tendency to want to move my tongue around when a have some type of dental object against my teeth and more than once  i have accidentally pushed the strips out of place  the gel helps to hold them in place but they can still be moved with little effort  also  if you start talking with a whitestrip in place there is a chance that some of your words will come out a little funny  like someone who has had a little too much to drink  i have found that  for best results  i try to do nothing at all when wearing crest whitestrips  the best thing to do is read a book  the time goes by quickly and it makes it easy to forget the strips are in place   waiting for fourteen days is frustrating and it is possible that you may need a second treatment after the first  depending on how well you stick to your 30 minute per day schedule and how well the whitestrips stayed in place  but the results should make you happy  at first i avoided crest whitestips because of the price and because of the product itself  spreading liquid gel on the teeth seemed much simpler than having to wear an object against one s teeth  i didn t like the idea of hassling with strips so i avoided buying crest whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first  i finally gave in and purchased crest whitestrips because i got tired of waiting for satisfactory results  and i did get good results with these strips  i followed the advice on the package and used the upper strips twice per day first  then the lower strips twice per day for the next seven days  this is a good idea because you can compare the shade of the top teeth with the bottom  right after the upper treatment is completed  i could see a significant difference as all those years of soda pop  coffee  tea  and other staining drinks were suddenly washed away   crest whitestrips use the same chemicals that dentist s use to clean and whiten teeth  so they are safe if used as directed  they are designed to keep teeth white for six months after each fourteen day period of usage  they also come with a money back guarantee  in order to get the guarantee  if you are not satisfied with the results  you can get a full refund of the purchase price provided you have followed the correct procedure for a refund   crest whitestrips work well  but like other over the counter whitening products  they only work on natural tooth enamel  they will not whiten dentures  caps  crowns  or other artificial dental material  if you have teeth with artificial surfaces that are badly stained  you will need to seek the help of a dentist or other professional to get rid of the problem   crest whitestrips are a little more expensive than the liquid whitening formulas but crest whitestrips are also more effective  i am satisfied with crest whitestrips and i recommend buying a box for effective treatment of discolored teeth  they are not as thorough as the treatment provided by a dentist but all things considered  these strips are a good buy  they eliminate stains and return your teeth to a more youthful appearance in only two weeks if used as directed ',\n",

       " 'i am a dentist who recommends crest brand white strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth  however  they have to be used correctly and i recommend that you follow the directions as specified inside the box   1  use the strips as directed on the box   the instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30 minutes a time   the inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide   in office  or dentist assisted dental whitening uses a 15 35  version of the same chemical  that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white  applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down   2  leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth  as this leads to sensitivity   disadvantages  1  hydrogen peroxide can  burn  your gums  if you notice a burning sensation when you use the product  it is the chemical oxidizing  or burning  your gums  it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn   depending on how severe the burning is  it may cause you to want to stop the treatment  it is ok to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal  once they are healed  resume treatment with the white strips  try to not get the strip on your gums   2  your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time  try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild  but if more severe  take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off  you may notice much more sensitivity to cold water  ice cream  etc   the peroxide causes a reversible inflamation of the inner pulp  or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods   if your teeth become too sensitive  back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching   3  the strips only cover your front teeth  so only your front teeth will bleach  you may notice the distinct difference between the back  unbleached  teeth and the front  bleached  teeth  since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway  this is not a big deal  however  if you have a wide toothy smile  you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too   4  the bleaching effect works best on yellow stains  if your stains are due to tetracycline  brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth  your best bet is to begin bleaching with yoru dentist and then use the strips to continue the bleaching process   now comes the confusing part  crest white strips come in 4 different packages  each a bit different than the others   the main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide  and the price   the higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide  the most costly the product package   here are the 4 packages   1  crest white strips classic  6  hydrogen peroxide  14 day treatment    2  crest white strips premium  10  hydrogen peroxide  7 day treatment    3  crest white strips premium plus  10  hydrogen peroxide  and has 12 additional strips    4  crest white strips renewal  9 5  hydrogen peroxide    the cheapest method  at around 25 dollars  is the crest classic whitestrips  but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment    premium and premium pro are both 10  peroxide formulations  work in 7 10 days  and the  premuim plus  gives you 12 additional strips   i am not sure why crest recently came out with  renewal   as it is a 9 5  hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10  concentration  leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer   crest white strips work for the vast majority of people  younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains   if you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth  you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching   this is much more expensive  but the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly stained teeth   jim  konedog  koenig  dds',\n",
